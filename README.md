## 🧭 **Overview**

This **Todo App** is a clean and responsive web application that helps you manage your daily tasks with style.  
It runs entirely in your browser — no backend, no dependencies — just **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
Tasks are saved automatically using **LocalStorage**, so your data persists even after refreshing or closing the browser.

---

## ⚡ **Features**

✅ Add, edit, and delete tasks easily  
✅ Mark tasks as *completed* or *active*  
✅ Filter by **All**, **Active**, or **Completed** tasks  
✅ Automatic data persistence via `localStorage`  
✅ Beautiful gradient design & smooth animations  
✅ 100% responsive for mobile and desktop users

## 🧠 **How It Works**

</div>

Each task you add is stored as an object in `localStorage`, like this:
```js
{
  id: 1696598400000,
  text: "Finish Todo App",
  completed: false,
  createdAt: "2025-10-06T10:00:00Z"
}
```
When you toggle or delete tasks, the app automatically updates and syncs the list.
